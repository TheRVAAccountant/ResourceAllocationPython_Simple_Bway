## üìã Pre-Rollback Checklist

### Immediate Assessment (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Confirm issue severity** using established criteria
- [ ] **Identify affected users** and scope of impact
- [ ] **Check system logs** for error patterns and root cause indicators
- [ ] **Verify backup availability** and integrity
- [ ] **Notify incident response team** and key stakeholders
- [ ] **Activate communication plan** for user notification

### Rollback Preparation (10 minutes)
- [ ] **Stop active processes** to prevent further data corruption
- [ ] **Create snapshot** of current state for analysis
- [ ] **Verify rollback environment** is ready and accessible
- [ ] **Prepare restoration scripts** and procedures
- [ ] **Brief rollback team** on procedures and assignments
- [ ] **Set up monitoring** for rollback process

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Rollback Procedures

### Method 1: Automated Rollback (Recommended - 15 minutes)

#### 1.1 Environment Preparation
```bash
# Navigate to rollback directory
cd /deployment/rollback

# Verify backup integrity
python scripts/verify_backup.py --backup-date=$(date -d "1 day ago" +%Y%m%d)

# Stop application services
./scripts/stop_application.sh

# Set rollback environment variables
export ROLLBACK_MODE=true
export ROLLBACK_VERSION=1.0.0
export ROLLBACK_TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```

#### 1.2 Application Rollback
```bash
# Restore previous application version
pip install resource-allocation-python==1.0.0 --force-reinstall

# Verify installation
resource-allocation --version  # Should show 1.0.0

# Restore configuration files
cp backups/config/.env.backup .env
cp backups/config/settings.yaml.backup config/settings.yaml

# Update feature flags to disable new features
export FEATURE_DUPLICATE_VALIDATION=disabled
export FEATURE_UNASSIGNED_VEHICLES=disabled
export FEATURE_THICK_BORDERS=disabled
```

#### 1.3 Data Restoration
```bash
# Restore Excel templates and data files
python scripts/restore_data.py \
  --backup-location backups/excel_data/ \
  --target-location data/ \
  --verify-integrity

# Restore user configuration
python scripts/restore_user_config.py \
  --backup-location backups/user_config/ \
  --target-location config/

# Clear any corrupted cache files
rm -rf logs/cache/*
rm -rf outputs/temp/*
```

#### 1.4 Validation and Restart
```bash
# Run rollback validation
python scripts/rollback_validation.py

# Start application services
./scripts/start_application.sh

# Verify application health
python scripts/health_check.py --comprehensive

# Log rollback completion
echo "$(date): Rollback to v1.0.0 completed successfully" >> logs/rollback.log
```

### Method 2: Manual Rollback (Emergency - 30 minutes)

#### 2.1 Manual Application Restore
```bash
# Stop all processes manually
pkill -f "resource-allocation"
pkill -f "python.*src/main.py"

# Manually remove current installation
rm -rf /opt/resource-allocation/current/*

# Extract backup version
tar -xzf backups/resource-allocation-v1.0.0.tar.gz -C /opt/resource-allocation/current/

# Set file permissions
chmod +x /opt/resource-allocation/current/scripts/*.sh
chown -R app_user:app_group /opt/resource-allocation/current/
```

#### 2.2 Manual Data Restore
```bash
# Backup current state for analysis
mkdir -p analysis/failed_deployment_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
cp -r data/ analysis/failed_deployment_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/
cp -r config/ analysis/failed_deployment_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/
cp -r logs/ analysis/failed_deployment_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/

# Restore data files
cp -r backups/excel_data/* data/
cp -r backups/user_config/* config/
cp backups/config/.env.backup .env

# Clear problematic files
find . -name "*.tmp" -delete
find . -name "*.lock" -delete
find outputs/ -name "*$(date +%Y-%m-%d)*" -delete
```

#### 2.3 Manual Service Restart
```bash
# Start application manually
cd /opt/resource-allocation/current
python -m src.main --safe-mode &

# Monitor startup
tail -f logs/application.log

# Test basic functionality
python scripts/basic_functionality_test.py
```

### Method 3: Emergency Data Recovery (Critical - 45 minutes)

#### 3.1 Data Corruption Recovery
```bash
# Identify corrupted files
python scripts/identify_corruption.py --scan-all

# Restore from multiple backup sources
python scripts/restore_from_multiple_backups.py \
  --primary-backup backups/daily/ \
  --secondary-backup backups/hourly/ \
  --verify-each-file

# Reconcile data integrity
python scripts/data_integrity_check.py --fix-inconsistencies
```

#### 3.2 User Data Recovery
```bash
# Restore user preferences and settings
python scripts/restore_user_preferences.py \
  --user-backup backups/user_data/ \
  --validate-preferences

# Restore recent file history
python scripts/restore_recent_files.py \
  --backup-location backups/user_sessions/

```python
# scripts/data_integrity_check.py
"""
Validate data integrity after rollback.
"""

import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

def check_data_integrity():
    """Check that all data files are intact and readable."""
    print("üîç Checking data integrity...")

    # Check template files
    template_files = [
        "data/templates/daily_summary_template.xlsx",
        "data/templates/day_of_ops_template.xlsx",
        "data/templates/daily_routes_template.xlsx"
    ]

    for file_path in template_files:
        try:
            if Path(file_path).exists():
                # Try to read the file
                df = pd.read_excel(file_path, nrows=5)
                print(f"‚úÖ {file_path}: Readable")
            else:
                print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  {file_path}: Missing")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"‚ùå {file_path}: Corrupted - {e}")
            return False

    print("‚úÖ Data integrity check completed")
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    success = check_data_integrity()
    sys.exit(0 if success else 1)
```
