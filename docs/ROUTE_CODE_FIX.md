# Route Code Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The Python implementation was generating synthetic route codes (R001, R002, R003) in the Daily Details sheet instead of using the actual route codes from the Day of Ops file (CX21, CX24, etc.) as shown in the Google Apps Script screenshot.

## Root Cause
The `_prepare_allocation_rows` method in `daily_details_writer.py` was generating synthetic route codes on line 385:
```python
f"R{len(rows)+1:03d}",  # Route code
```

This was happening because the basic `AllocationResult` model only stores driver-to-vehicle mappings, not the detailed route information including route codes.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Storage
The GAS-compatible allocator now stores detailed allocation results in the metadata field:
```python
allocation_result = AllocationResult(
    # ... other fields ...
    metadata={
        "detailed_results": self.allocation_results  # Contains full route details
    }
)
```

### 2. Updated Daily Details Writer
Modified `_prepare_allocation_rows` method to:
- Check for detailed results in metadata
- Use actual route codes when available
- Fall back to synthetic codes only for non-GAS allocators

### 3. Updated Results Sheet Creation
Modified `_create_results_sheet` method to:
- Use detailed results from metadata when available
- Populate all columns with actual data from allocation

## Key Changes

### daily_details_writer.py
```python
# Check if we have detailed results in metadata (from GAS allocator)
detailed_results = allocation_result.metadata.get("detailed_results", [])

if detailed_results:
    # Use detailed results from GAS allocator which includes route codes
    for result in detailed_results:
        route_code = result.get("Route Code", "")  # Actual route code
        driver_name = result.get("Associate Name", "")  # Actual driver name
        # ... populate row with actual data ...
```

## Verification
Created test script that confirms:
- ✓ Route codes match Day of Ops file (CX21, CX24, etc.)
- ✓ Driver names match Daily Routes file
- ✓ Unique identifiers use actual route codes
- ✓ Results sheet contains correct route information

## Impact
- GAS-compatible allocator now produces output identical to Google Apps Script
- Non-GAS allocators still work with synthetic route codes as fallback
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Improved data accuracy and traceability

## Usage
When using the GAS-compatible allocator, the system will automatically:
1. Read route codes from Day of Ops file
2. Store them in allocation results
3. Write actual route codes to Daily Details sheet
4. Generate unique identifiers with real route codes

This ensures complete compatibility with the existing Google Apps Script workflow.
