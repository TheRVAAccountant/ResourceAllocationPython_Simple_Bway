# GeoTab and Type Field Population Fix

## Issue Description
The Daily Details sheet was showing empty values for the GeoTab Code and Type columns when running allocations through the Python application, despite these fields being populated correctly in the Google Apps Script version.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. GeoTab Code Field
- **Issue**: Column name mismatch between Vehicle Log sheet and expected column name
- **Vehicle Log has**: "GeoTab"
- **Code expected**: "GeoTab Code"
- **Result**: Field lookup failed, leaving column empty

### 2. Type Field
- **Issue**: Wrong data source being used
- **Current behavior**: Using vehicle type ("Large", "Extra Large")
- **Expected behavior**: Using ownership type ("Branded" or "Rental") from Vehicle Log
- **Result**: Incorrect data type populated

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Vehicle Log Loading
Modified `src/core/gas_compatible_allocator.py` to include intelligent column mapping:

```python
def load_vehicle_log(self, file_path: str, sheet_name: str = "Vehicle Log") -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Load Vehicle Log with intelligent column mapping."""

    # Normalize column names to lowercase for comparison
    df.columns = df.columns.str.strip()
    normalized_cols = {col: col.lower().replace(' ', '_') for col in df.columns}

    # Create mapping for expected columns
    column_mapping = {}

    # Map Van ID variations
    for orig_col, norm_col in normalized_cols.items():
        if norm_col in ['van_id', 'vanid', 'vehicle_id']:
            column_mapping[orig_col] = 'Van ID'

    # Map VIN variations
    for orig_col, norm_col in normalized_cols.items():
        if norm_col == 'vin':
            column_mapping[orig_col] = 'VIN'

    # Map GeoTab variations - THIS IS THE KEY FIX
    for orig_col, norm_col in normalized_cols.items():
        if norm_col in ['geotab', 'geo_tab', 'geotab_code']:
            column_mapping[orig_col] = 'GeoTab'

    # Map Branded or Rental variations
    for orig_col, norm_col in normalized_cols.items():
        if norm_col in ['branded_or_rental', 'type', 'ownership']:
            column_mapping[orig_col] = 'Branded or Rental'
```

### Data Flow Correction

The complete data flow now works as follows:

1. **Vehicle Log Sheet** → Contains actual column names (e.g., "GeoTab", "Branded or Rental")
2. **GAS Allocator** → Maps columns intelligently to standard names
3. **vehicle_log_dict** → Built with correct field names:
   ```python
   {
       "vin": "1FTYR10D3YPA80259",
       "geotab": "410998- Netradyne",  # Now correctly mapped
       "brand_or_rental": "Branded",    # Now correctly populated
   }
   ```
4. **Daily Details Writer** → Populates fields correctly

## Testing and Verification

### Test Data Used
Created comprehensive test with Vehicle Log containing:
- Van ID: BW48, BW49, etc.
- VIN: Various VIN numbers
- GeoTab: "410998- Netradyne", "413298- Netradyne", etc.
- Branded or Rental: Mix of "Branded" and "Rental"

### Results
All fields now populate correctly:
- ✅ GeoTab Code: Shows actual device IDs from Vehicle Log
- ✅ Type: Shows "Branded" or "Rental" as expected
- ✅ Route Type: Shows full Service Type text
- ✅ All other fields: Populated as per GAS implementation

## Before vs After Comparison

| Field | Before Fix | After Fix |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| GeoTab Code | Empty | "410998- Netradyne" |
| Type | Empty or "Large" | "Branded" or "Rental" |
| Route Type | "Standard" | "Standard Parcel - Large Van" |

## Key Improvements

1. **Flexible Column Mapping**: System now handles variations in column names
2. **Better Error Handling**: Continues with partial data if some columns missing
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Shows column mappings applied for debugging
4. **Backwards Compatibility**: Still works with exact column names

## Files Modified

1. **`src/core/gas_compatible_allocator.py`**
   - Enhanced `load_vehicle_log()` method
   - Added column normalization and mapping logic
   - Improved error handling and logging

2. **`src/services/daily_details_writer.py`**
   - Already had correct logic, no changes needed
   - Properly uses vehicle_log_dict when provided

## Usage Notes

- Vehicle Log sheet can now have flexible column names
- System automatically detects and maps common variations
- Missing Vehicle Log sheet results in warning but allocation continues
- All mappings are logged for transparency

## Conclusion

The Python Resource Allocation application now correctly populates all fields in the Daily Details sheet, including GeoTab Code and Type fields, matching the Google Apps Script implementation exactly. The intelligent column mapping ensures robustness against minor column name variations while maintaining data integrity.
