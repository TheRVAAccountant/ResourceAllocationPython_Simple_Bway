# /ra-orchestrate

Master project orchestration command for complex multi-agent coordination and comprehensive project tasks.

## Usage
```
/ra-orchestrate <project_task> [--scope=<feature|system|integration>] [--timeline=<sprint|release|major>] [--include-all-agents]
```

## Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Feature Epic Development
**Scope**: Complete feature with all supporting components
**Timeline**: 2-4 hours of focused development
**Agents**: All agents coordinated by resource-allocation-expert

```
Workflow:
1. resource-allocation-expert: Business analysis and requirements
2. excel-integration-specialist: Data layer and Excel integration design
3. gui-ux-specialist: User interface design and mockups
4. Parallel Implementation Phase:
   - Core business logic (resource-allocation-expert)
   - Excel processing (excel-integration-specialist)
   - GUI components (gui-ux-specialist)
5. testing-qa-specialist: Comprehensive testing strategy
6. performance-optimization-specialist: Performance validation
7. deployment-devops-specialist: Deployment preparation
```

### Pattern 2: System Integration & Migration
**Scope**: Large-scale system changes or integrations
**Timeline**: Multi-day coordinated effort
**Agents**: Specialized coordination with domain expert oversight

```
Workflow:
1. resource-allocation-expert: Impact analysis and migration strategy
2. excel-integration-specialist: Data migration and compatibility
3. performance-optimization-specialist: Scalability assessment
4. testing-qa-specialist: Integration testing framework
5. deployment-devops-specialist: Migration deployment strategy
6. gui-ux-specialist: User experience during transition
```

### Pattern 3: Production Issue Resolution
**Scope**: Critical production problems requiring immediate attention
**Timeline**: Emergency response (1-4 hours)
**Agents**: Parallel investigation with rapid coordination

```
Emergency Workflow:
1. Immediate triage (resource-allocation-expert)
2. Parallel investigation:
   - Excel data issues (excel-integration-specialist)
   - GUI/UX problems (gui-ux-specialist)
   - Performance degradation (performance-optimization-specialist)
   - Environment issues (deployment-devops-specialist)
3. Coordinated resolution and testing (testing-qa-specialist)
4. Emergency deployment and monitoring
```

## Project Scenarios

## Coordination Mechanisms

### Communication Protocols
- **Lead Agent Assignment**: Primary domain expert leads coordination
- **Parallel Work Streams**: Independent agents work on complementary components
- **Integration Points**: Scheduled coordination for component integration
- **Quality Gates**: Staged validation with go/no-go decisions
- **Escalation Procedures**: Clear escalation paths for blockers or conflicts

### Handoff Standards
- **Interface Contracts**: Clear APIs and data contracts between components
- **Documentation Requirements**: Comprehensive documentation for handoffs
- **Testing Protocols**: Integration testing at each handoff point
- **Review Processes**: Peer review and validation before handoffs
- **Rollback Procedures**: Clear rollback plans for each integration step

### Quality Assurance
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing throughout development
- **Cross-Agent Reviews**: Peer review across different specializations
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end validation of complete workflows
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Continuous performance validation
- **User Acceptance**: Real-world scenario validation and user feedback

## Advanced Orchestration Features

### Dynamic Agent Selection
```python
# Intelligent agent routing based on task analysis
def select_agents(task_description, complexity, timeline):
    if "excel" in task_description.lower():
        agents.append("excel-integration-specialist")
    if "gui" in task_description.lower():
        agents.append("gui-ux-specialist")
    if complexity == "high":
        agents.append("performance-optimization-specialist")
    return optimize_agent_coordination(agents, timeline)
```

### Parallel Processing Coordination
- **Task Decomposition**: Break complex tasks into parallel work streams
- **Dependency Management**: Track and manage cross-agent dependencies
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimize agent utilization and workload balancing
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into multi-agent progress
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automated detection and resolution of conflicts

### Quality Metrics & KPIs
- **Development Velocity**: Track feature delivery speed with agent coordination
- **Quality Scores**: Measure code quality, test coverage, and defect rates
- **Integration Efficiency**: Monitor handoff success rates and integration time
- **User Satisfaction**: Track user experience and adoption metrics
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor system performance and optimization results
