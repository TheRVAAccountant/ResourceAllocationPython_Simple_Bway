# GUI Updates Summary - GAS-Compatible Allocation

## Overview
The GUI has been updated to match the Google Apps Script (GAS) workflow exactly, requiring three input files and writing results back to the Daily Summary Log.

## Key Changes

### 1. File Input Structure
The GUI now requests **3 input files** (previously only 1):

- **Day of Ops Excel File** (`Day_of_Ops.xlsx`)
  - Sheet: "Solution"
  - Contains: Route Code, Service Type, DSP, Wave, Staging Location
  - Purpose: Defines all routes needing vehicle assignments

- **Daily Routes Excel File** (`Daily_Routes.xlsx`)
  - Sheet: "Routes"
  - Contains: Route Code, Driver Name
  - Purpose: Maps drivers to specific routes

- **Daily Summary Log** (`Daily Summary Log 2025.xlsx`)
  - Input Sheet: "Vehicle Status" (Van ID, Type, Opnal? Y/N)
  - Purpose: Provides available vehicles AND receives output
  - **This file serves as both input and output** (matching GAS behavior)

### 2. Output Behavior
- **No separate output file needed** - results are written back to Daily Summary Log
- Creates/updates three sheets in the Daily Summary Log:
  1. **Daily Details** - Cumulative historical record (appends new data)
  2. **MM-DD-YY Results** - Today's allocation results
  3. **MM-DD-YY Available & Unassigned** - Unassigned vehicles

### 3. Allocation Process
The GUI now uses `GASCompatibleAllocator` which follows the exact GAS logic:

1. Load Day of Ops → Filter for DSP = "BWAY" routes
2. Load Daily Routes → Get driver-to-route mappings
3. Load Vehicle Status → Filter for operational vehicles (Opnal? = "Y")
4. Match service types to vehicle types:
   - "Standard Parcel - Extra Large Van - US" → "Extra Large"
   - "Standard Parcel - Large Van" → "Large"
   - "Standard Parcel Step Van - US" → "Step Van"
   - "Nursery Route Level X" → "Large"
5. Allocate vehicles using first-come-first-served
6. Map driver names from Daily Routes
7. Write results back to Daily Summary Log

### 4. User Interface Updates
- Clear labeling: "File Selection (GAS-Compatible Workflow)"
- Daily Summary Log labeled as "(Input/Output)" to clarify dual purpose
- Help text explains the workflow
- Progress updates for each allocation step
- Results display shows GAS-specific statistics

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Consistency** - Matches Google Apps Script workflow exactly
2. **Historical Tracking** - Daily Details accumulates all allocations over time
3. **Simplified Process** - One less file to manage (no separate output)
4. **Audit Trail** - All data in one master file (Daily Summary Log)
5. **Operational Efficiency** - Same file structure as existing GAS process

## Usage Instructions

1. Select your Day of Ops file
2. Select your Daily Routes file
3. Select your Daily Summary Log file (this will receive the output)
4. Click "Run Allocation"
5. Results will be written back to the Daily Summary Log

The Daily Details sheet in the Daily Summary Log will accumulate historical data with each run, providing a complete allocation history.
